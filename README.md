# Tolerant Luddic Majority

## Description

This mod adjusts the **Luddic Majority** condition to be more tolerant toward certain industries, while still accounting for factors that can negate its bonuses.

## Features

- Overrides vanilla Luddic Church hostile activity behavior to prevent conflicts with modded bonuses.
- Tooltips and Codex support clearly explain bonuses and active negating factors.
- Heavy industry can be partially exempted via mod settings (e.g., **Mining**, **Tech-Mining**) without removing the negating factor entirely.
- Users can **disable any or all negating factors** via mod settings to ensure the bonuses always apply.
## Notes

- Vanilla Luddic Church listeners that interfere with the condition are automatically removed, without affecting hostile activity events.
